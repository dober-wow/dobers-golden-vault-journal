        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Freya is an Eladrin of striking, otherworldly beauty. Her skin is a luminous pale lavender-silver that seems
            to shimmer faintly like moonlight on still water. Long, flowing hair in deep violet with streaks of ethereal
            silver frames her sharp, fey features—high cheekbones, a narrow chin, and large almond-shaped eyes that glow
            with an unsettling amber-gold light, the flame-like flicker betraying the wild magic that courses through
            her veins.</p>

        <p>Most striking are the faint arcane patterns that occasionally crackle across her skin like distant
            lightning—unpredictable surges of raw magical energy made visible. Delicate pointed ears adorned with small
            silver rings peek through her hair, and her expression carries a balance of mischief and mystery that keeps
            others guessing at her true intentions.</p>

        <p>She wears practical dark leather armor suited for a rogue's trade—fitted but functional, with subtle buckles
            and pouches for thieves' tools. A hooded traveling cloak in deep purple drapes over one shoulder, ready to
            conceal her features when discretion is needed. At her hip hangs her <strong>Moon-Touched Sword</strong>—a
            shortsword that glows with pale, cold moonlight, cutting through darkness wherever she walks.</p>
