        <img src="../assets/characters/maltus_portrait.png" alt="Maltus Draught" class="portrait">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A lean tiefling with slate-grey skin and short, swept-back horns that have been filed flat at the
            tips—a deliberate attempt to look "less infernal" that only makes him more unsettling. His eyes are pale
            gold, almost milky, giving him a perpetual look of knowing more than he should. A thin scar runs from his
            left temple to jaw—a souvenir from a "collection" gone wrong.</p>

        <p>Mal dresses in the understated elegance of casino floor staff: a fitted charcoal waistcoat over a deep
            burgundy shirt, sleeves rolled to the elbow revealing faded brand scars on his forearms—the mark of
            Afterlife Casino "enforcers." He carries a worn deck of Three-Dragon Ante cards that serves as his holy
            symbol, each card subtly defaced with symbols of the Trickster gods.</p>

        <h3>Mannerisms</h3>
        <p>Speaks in a measured, almost therapeutic cadence—the voice of someone who has talked desperate gamblers out
            of (and into) terrible decisions. Shuffles his cards when thinking. Never sits with his back to a door. Has
            a habit of naming exactly how much gold someone is carrying just by watching them move.</p>
