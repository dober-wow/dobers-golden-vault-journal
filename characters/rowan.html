        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rowan moves through the world like a held breath—silent, tense, and acutely aware. Lean and wiry, they
            possess the whipcord physique of someone who has spent years stalking prey through forest undergrowth and
            cavern shadow, where bulk is a liability and stillness is survival. Their weathered face carries the
            thousand-yard stare of a veteran soldier, eyes that have learned to pierce darkness and anticipate danger
            before it materializes.</p>

        <p>Their dark hair is cropped short and practical, never long enough to catch on a bowstring or obscure
            peripheral vision. A faint network of pale scars traces their forearms—souvenirs from monstrous claws that
            taught hard lessons about the things that hunt in the black. They dress for function over form: well-worn
            studded leather armor that has been maintained with military precision, each buckle and strap positioned for
            silent movement and quick access.</p>

        <p>A longbow of dark, oiled wood rests within easy reach, the weapon an extension of Rowan's patient lethality.
            They carry themselves with the coiled readiness of a hunting cat, weight balanced on the balls of their
            feet, head cocked slightly as if perpetually listening for sounds others cannot hear. In bright light, Rowan
            seems almost uncomfortable—too exposed, too visible. But catch them in shadow, and you'll see the
            transformation: a predator coming home, melting into the darkness until only their watchful eyes remain.</p>
