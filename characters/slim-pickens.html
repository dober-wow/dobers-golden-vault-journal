        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A weathered Lightfoot Halfling with a roguish glint in his pale grey-blue eyes. His face is creased from
            years of squinting through smoke and shadow, with a perpetual half-smirk that suggests he knows something
            you don't. A thin cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth.</p>

        <p>He wears a wide-brimmed black hat adorned with a vulture feather tucked into its silver-buckled band, casting
            his features in permanent dramatic shadow. His dark leather duster is worn and travel-stained, the collar
            turned up against his thin, scraggly beard, and his gloved hands are never far from his belt or his blades.
            Worn leather cowboy boots—scuffed and dusty from countless miles—complete the gunslinger aesthetic.</p>

        <h3>The Vulture Familiar</h3>
        <p>A gaunt vulture with mottled dark plumage and piercing amber eyes that seem to hold an unsettling
            intelligence. Imposingly large—nearly half the height of the halfling himself when perched—its bald,
            wrinkled head and hunched posture give it a sinister appearance, hinting at its connection to something
            otherworldly—the Djinni patron that binds it to Slim.</p>

        <h3>Together</h3>
        <p>The pair move as one—the vulture perched on Slim's shoulder like a dark omen given form. Where Slim's eyes
            might wander or his attention drift, the vulture watches, and vice versa. They share a quiet, unspoken
            partnership; the halfling's smug confidence is matched by his familiar's grim patience. Together, they look
            like trouble waiting to happen—or trouble that's already arrived.</p>
