    <h2>Act 1: The Mission</h2>

    <h3>The Golden Key</h3>
    <p>The party received an ornate envelope bearing the symbol of the <strong>Golden Vault</strong>. Inside was a
      golden key that fit a mysterious music box that appeared nearby. The Patron's voice delivered the mission:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"The egg of an eldritch horror has been mistaken for a historical object and is about to go on display at the
        Varkenbluff Museum of Natural History..."</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Meeting Dr. Cassee Dannell</h3>
    <p>At the <strong>Sage's Quill Tavern</strong>, the party met their contact—a frantic, worried anthropologist in a
      purple hooded robe.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Intel Received:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The "Murkmire Stone" is actually an <strong>Eldritch Egg</strong> set to hatch at <strong>midnight</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Dr. Dannell was <strong>fired</strong> from the university and caught trying to steal the egg</li>
      <li>She provided: <strong>4 Gala Tickets</strong>, a <strong>Bag of Holding</strong>, and a <strong>rough museum
          map</strong></li>
      <li>The egg's pedestal is pressure-sensitive—requires a <strong>swap with equal weight</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Act 2: The Gala</h2>

    <h3>Arrival &amp; Recon</h3>
    <p>The party arrived at the <strong>Varkenbluff Museum</strong> for the opening gala. <strong>Captain Maryam
        Bikram</strong> of the City Watch checked tickets at the entrance. She notably approved of Slim's cowboy formal
      attire:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"The cowboy hat, the bolo tie and the boots... that's formal in my book, partner."</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Sareena Shu</strong> at the gift shop was asked about obtaining a <strong>Murkmire Stone replica</strong>
      for the swap.</p>

    <h3>Curator Alda Arkin's Speech</h3>
    <p>Alda addressed the gathered guests in the <strong>Gemstone Wing</strong> with thinly-veiled contempt for Dr.
      Dannell:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"Some 'academics'—and I use that term loosely—would have you believe this is something sinister. A curse. A
        monster in disguise. It is frankly... embarrassing."</em>
    </blockquote>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="../assets/audio/alda_murkmire_intro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    <p>She invited guests to admire the <strong>Allosaur skeleton</strong> and the Murkmire Stone, emphasizing:
      <em>"True power lies not in fear, but in possession."</em></p>

    <h2>Act 3: The Heist</h2>

      alt="Chaos erupts as the flaming Allosaur rampages through the museum">

    <h3>The Distraction</h3>
    <p><strong>Slim Pickens</strong> discretely cast <strong>Bonfire</strong> on the Allosaur skeleton, setting the
      ancient bones ablaze. The magical flames caused an unexpected reaction—the skeleton <strong>animated</strong> and
      began rampaging through the museum, thankfully running <em>away</em> from the gala attendees rather than toward
      them.</p>

      <source src="../assets/audio/bikram_panic_code_red.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>

    <h3>The Swap</h3>
    <p>While attention was fixed on the flaming, animated dinosaur, the party executed a coordinated swap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Slim</strong> replaced the Murkmire Stone with a <strong>10 lb bag</strong> as a counterweight</li>
      <li><strong>Freya</strong> immediately cast <strong>Minor Illusion</strong> over the bag to disguise it as the
        stone</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The decoy held—for now.</p>

    <h3>The Escape</h3>
    <p>As the party moved with the egg, the jostling caused it to <strong>emit an eerie noise</strong>—alerting gala
      attendees that something was amiss and drawing attention to the team's escape. Despite being spotted, they managed
      to slip away:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Slipped away to the <strong>attic</strong></li>
      <li>Escaped through a <strong>skylight</strong></li>
      <li>Climbed down the <strong>west side</strong> of the building</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Rendezvous with Dr. Dannell</h3>
    <p>The party met Dr. Dannell in the tavern as planned. She quickly placed the Murkmire Stone (eldritch egg) into her
      <strong>Crystal Box</strong>, encasing it and <strong>rendering it inert</strong>—the city was saved from a
      midnight hatching.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"Sweet Lathander, look at the sky! The smoke... I told Alda, 'It's not a rock, it's a bomb'... Who's the
        scientist now, Alda?!"</em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Act 4: The Manhunt</h2>

    <h3>Alda's Fury</h3>
    <p>Back at the museum, Alda ordered a <strong>citywide manhunt</strong>, specifically mentioning "the cowboy":</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"Those guys, the cowboy, everybody. We need a manhunt. I don't care if it was them or not, we need to know
        where they're at."</em>
    </blockquote>

      <source src="../assets/audio/alda_cowboy_manhunt.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>

    <h3>Code Red</h3>
    <p><strong>Guard Grendor Battleaxe</strong> and others began stopping citizens throughout the city:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"Captain Bikram's got us on high alert. Looking for some troublemakers from the museum incident."</em>
    </blockquote>

    <audio controls>
      <source src="../assets/audio/grendor_code_red.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>

    <h3>Slipping Through</h3>
    <p>Thanks to a <strong>high Dexterity roll</strong>, the party managed to stay in the shadows and
      <strong>overheard</strong> the guards questioning citizens—but were <strong>never stopped themselves</strong>.
      They slipped through the manhunt undetected.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Aftermath &amp; Cliffhanger</h2>

    <h3>Mission Complete</h3>
    <p>The party successfully delivered the egg to Dr. Dannell, who encased it in her Crystal Box. <strong>The city was
        saved.</strong> Dr. Dannell paid the party their promised reward.</p>

    <h3>Dr. Dannell's New Problem</h3>
    <p>Dr. Dannell approached the party with a follow-up request. She wanted to go to the Dean to reclaim her position,
      armed with proof of the egg's true nature.</p>

    <h3>The Party's Response</h3>
    <p><strong>The party declined.</strong> They accepted their reward and <strong>refused to help Dr. Dannell any
        further</strong>. Her tenure problems are not their concern.</p>

    <h3>The End</h3>
    <p>The Golden Vault Patron offered congratulations on the successful heist, albeit unorthodox.</p>
