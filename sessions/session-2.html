        <h3>Disguises En Route</h3>
        <p>The party adopted disguises traveling to meet their contact:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood Feather</strong> dyed his feathers black</li>
            <li><strong>Slim Pickens</strong> removed his signature cowboy hat</li>
            <li><strong>Captain Kiara</strong> put on a hood</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meeting Verity Kye</h3>
        <p>At the Brine Widow tavern, the party met <strong>Verity Kye</strong>—a bold tiefling entrepreneur with a
            score to settle.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"The Afterlife Casino is a new Nine Hells–themed attraction just outside town. The owner, Quentin
                Togglepocket, built it using prize money he stole from ME—and I'd like you to give him HELL."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steal the <strong>erinyes statuette</strong> (tournament prize)</li>
            <li>Recover <strong>5,000 gold pieces</strong> Quentin stole from Verity</li>
            <li>Embarrass Quentin in front of the tournament's high-profile guests</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Introducing Maltus Draught</h3>
        <p>Verity introduced a new team member:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"This is Maltus Draught. He goes by Mal. He used to work at the Afterlife—knows the layout, the staff
                rotations, the back hallways most guests never see. More importantly, he knows how Quentin thinks."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Maltus's Role:</strong> Inside man, assigned by the Golden Vault. Carries a defaced deck of
            Three-Dragon Ante cards as his holy symbol.</p>

        <h3>Warning for Slim</h3>
        <p>Verity specifically warned Slim about his recognizable appearance:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"The whole city is talking about the museum fire. That wide-brimmed hat of yours? It might as well be a
                WANTED poster. Lose the hat. Change the look. Or don't go in at all."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Slim's hat was stored in the bag of holding. Maltus took possession of the bag.

        <h3>Life and Death Game</h3>
        <p><strong>Slim Pickens</strong> and <strong>Blood Feather</strong> tried their luck at the casino's signature
            dice game.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Round 1: 10 gp each—House wins</li>
            <li>Round 2: 20 gp each—Both lose (-30 gp total)</li>
            <li>Round 3: Blood Feather won with a 5</li>
            <li>Round 4: Pushed his luck and won 60 gp → 90 gp total</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Blood Feather tipped the dealer 1 gp.</p>

        <h3>The Key Card Heist</h3>
        <p>The party executed a coordinated theft to acquire a staff pass card:</p>

            alt="Blood Feather lifts the dealer's pass card while Slim provides a distraction">

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maltus:</strong> Blessed Blood Feather with advantage</li>
            <li><strong>Slim:</strong> Created a distraction at the table</li>
            <li><strong>Kiara:</strong> Served as lookout</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> ✅ Key card acquired + 15 gp taken</p>

        <h3>Tournament Chip Theft</h3>
        <p>Blood Feather waited 7 minutes for the right moment, then stole a significant stack of chips from the
            tournament leader.</p>
        <p><strong>Complication:</strong> The chips are tournament-only—cannot be cashed directly.</p>

            alt="Blood Feather delivers the killing blow to the hydra with his psychic blades">

        <h3>The Fight</h3>
        <p>The party got caught up in the casino's circus attraction and fought:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Hydra</strong></li>
            <li><strong>3 Bamboons</strong> (demonic baboons)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slim got beat up badly</li>
            <li>Blood Feather finished the hydra with his <strong>psychic blades</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Crowd's Reaction</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"Did you SEE that?! The kenku took down a hell HYDRA!"</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Gold coins changed hands as bets were settled. This wasn't a disaster—it was the best show the Afterlife's
            had in months.</p>

        <h3>The Entrance</h3>
        <p>Quentin descended from his private balcony, slow-clapping:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Magnificent. Truly, magnificent."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Acknowledgment</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"Do you have any idea how much those animals cost me? The hell hounds alone are imported from
                Avernus."</em>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"And do you know what I'm thinking right now? Worth every copper."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Recognizing Maltus</h3>
        <p>Quentin spotted his former enforcer:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Well, well. Maltus Draught. I was wondering when you'd crawl back. Though I admit, I expected you'd
                come begging for your old job—not... this."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Second Gambling Session</h3>

            <li>Blood Feather bet 100 gp—Lost...</li>
