        <h1>Session 3: The Stygian Gambit (Part 2)</h1>

        <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 30, 2026<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> The Afterlife Casino<br>
            <strong>Adventure:</strong> The Stygian Gambit (Keys From The Golden Vault)
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Previously...</h2>

        <p>The party descended into the Afterlife Casino with a mission: steal the golden erinyes statuette, recover
            five thousand gold pieces, and embarrass Quentin Togglepocket in front of his guests.</p>

        <p>They arrived in disguise. Blood Feather's feathers dyed black. Slim's cowboy hat hidden away. Captain Kiara
            hooded and watchful. And at their side, a new ally—<strong>Maltus Draught</strong>—former enforcer, current
            traitor to his old master.</p>

        <p>The tables were kind... eventually. Blood Feather pushed his luck and won big. Then came the real work: a
            lifted pass card, stolen tournament chips, dirty deals in the shadows.</p>

        <p>And then the circus happened. A hydra. Demonic baboons. The crowd screaming. And Blood Feather—psychic blades
            glowing purple—driving them straight through the hydra's final head.</p>

        <p>The Afterlife Casino had its new champion. But celebration came with a price. Quentin Togglepocket descended
            from his balcony. He slow-clapped. He smiled. And he looked directly at Maltus.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Well, well. Maltus Draught. I was wondering when you'd crawl back."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>There's history there. Unfinished business. And now Quentin is watching.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 1: The Maryam Bikram Confrontation</h2>

        <p>The session opened with an unexpected complication. <strong>Maryam Bikram</strong>, Captain of the
            Varkenbluff Museum guard, recognized the party from the Murkmire Malevolence job. Off-duty and gambling, she
            was furious about the three weeks of double shifts caused by the Allosaur skeleton incident.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"You're the ones who burned down the Allosaur skeleton. You're the reason I've been doing double shifts
                for THREE WEEKS."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">

        </audio>

        <p>She demanded 35 gp for her silence. The party paid in full—then tried to pickpocket it back. Failed
            miserably. She noticed.</p>

        <p>Maryam took the gold and returned to the dice tables with a warning: <em>"If I hear about ANY trouble
                tonight... I'm talking."</em></p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 2: Day 1 Reconnaissance</h2>

        <p>With the immediate threat handled, the party began planning.</p>

        <h3>Blood Feather's Invisible Recon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maltus cast <em>Invisibility</em> on Blood Feather</li>
            <li>Blood Feather entered Quentin's office through the staff door</li>
            <li><strong>Complication:</strong> Quentin noticed something (possibly the door movement)</li>
            <li>Quentin became <strong>ON ALERT</strong> but Blood Feather escaped undetected</li>
            <li>Explored the back hallways — found nothing of note</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Rat Race</h3>
        <p>When Quentin emerged for his evening rounds, the party used the distraction to blend in at the rat racing
            tables. Blood Feather bet 10 gp on Rat #3 and won (+30 gp profit).</p>

        <h3>The Gold Coin Revelation</h3>
        <p>Quentin's gold coin (received after the hydra fight) was revealed to be a <strong>hotel room comp</strong>.
            The party decided to spend the night and execute the heist the following day at dusk.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 3: The Coordinated Heist</h2>

        <p>At dusk the next day, the team divided responsibilities:</p>

        <h2>Act 4: The Vault Heist</h2>

        <p>During Quentin's rounds, Maltus cast <em>Invisibility</em> on Blood Feather.</p>

        <h3>Quentin's Office</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood Feather located the <strong>glass display case key</strong> in the top desk drawer</li>
            <li>Retrieved <strong>Virgil's Rod</strong> (bone rod with copper minotaur heads) — placed in Bag of Holding
            </li>
            <li>Passed the glass key to Kiara for relay to Slim</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Vault — Gold Extraction</h3>

        <p>Blood Feather used the pass card to bypass the fire trap and entered the vault. The gold extraction was
            methodical:</p>

        <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1rem 0;">

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Blood Feather exceeded the 5,000 gp mission requirement by 4,000 gp.</p>

        <h2>Act 5: The Statuette Grab — "Smokescreen Relay"</h2>

        <p>With the vault cleared, the team executed their statuette plan.</p>

        <h3>The Distraction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blood Feather (still invisible) used <em>Prestidigitation</em> to soil one guard's pants</li>

            <li>A smoke bomb was deployed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Grab</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slim Pickens unlocked the display case with the glass key</li>
            <li>Freya grabbed the Golden Erinyes Statuette and placed it in the Bag of Holding</li>
            <li>A rock was placed on the pedestal as weight replacement</li>
            <li>Freya cast <em>Minor Illusion</em> to make the rock appear as the statuette</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Complication — Freya Grappled</h3>
        <p>On the way out, Freya was grappled by a guard who saw through the chaos—but she broke free and escaped via
            misty step.</p>

        <h2>Act 7: The Escape</h2>

        <h3>Blood Feather Secures the Boat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Moved ahead to the ferry dock</li>
            <li>Identified <strong>Tim</strong>, a tiefling ferrier working the late shift</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Captain Kiara's Sprint</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Used her 180 ft movement to close distance rapidly</li>
            <li>Ensured the party could reach the ferry before pursuit closed in</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tim the Tiefling Ferrier</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood Feather offered Tim 100 gp to ferry them across</li>
            <li>When Tim hesitated, Blood Feather threatened him with a dagger</li>
            <li>Tim reluctantly agreed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Escape Coordination</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood Feather dropped a rope in the water behind the ferry to slow pursuers</li>
            <li>Party reached the carriage rendezvous point</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 8: The Dark Turn — Tim's Murder</h2>

        <p>After securing the boat and reaching the carriage meeting point, the party faced a choice about <strong>Tim
                the tiefling ferrier</strong>—a witness to their escape who could identify them.</p>

        <p>Tim refused to accompany the group further. He just wanted to be paid and return to his normal life. Blood
            Feather gave Tim 100 gp for the ferry ride.</p>

        <h3>The Frame Job</h3>
        <p>Blood Feather, planning ahead, slipped the following items into Tim's pocket without his knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>glass display case key</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Two security pass cards</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <em>Intent: If Tim's body is found, the planted evidence makes him appear to be the "inside man" for the
                heist.</em>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Murder</h3>
        <p><strong>Freya</strong> lured Tim away from the group and slit his throat.</p>

        <img src="../assets/sessions/murder_at_docks.png" alt="Freya stands over Tim's body as Slim looks on in horror">

        <p><strong>Slim was not happy.</strong></p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"This isn't how I operate."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This moment created <strong>significant friction</strong> between Slim and Freya/Blood Feather. Slim made
            clear that murdering an innocent bystander violated his personal code. The divide may simmer — or erupt — in
            future sessions.</p>

            <li><strong>Tim the Ferrier:</strong> Dead. Framed as inside man.</li>

        <h2>Party Tension</h2>

        <p>The murder of Tim created a rift within the group. Slim did not agree with killing an innocent bystander who
            posed no real threat.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"He was a FERRIER. He rowed BOATS. He wasn't gonna talk—WE PAID him!"</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p><em>This may simmer into future conflict.</em></p>
