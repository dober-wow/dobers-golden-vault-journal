        <h1>Session 4: Reach for the Stars</h1>

        <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 7, 2026<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Varkenbluff → Forest Road → Delphi Mansion (threshold)<br>
            <strong>Adventure:</strong> Reach for the Stars — Bridge Session (Keys From The Golden Vault)
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Previously...</h2>

        <p>The Stygian Gambit ended in blood and gold. The party robbed Quentin Togglepocket's vault of 9,000 gold
            pieces, stole the Golden Erinyes statuette, and escaped across the river — but not before Freya
            slit the throat of Tim, the tiefling ferrier who'd helped them flee.</p>

        <p>Now they're in a stagecoach, heading back toward Varkenbluff with a fortune in stolen gold and an
            uncomfortable silence between them.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 1: The Stagecoach</h2>

        <p>The session opened with the narrator recap — the full weight of what happened last session delivered
            in a single breath.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/narrator_recap.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Inside the stagecoach, the rift was palpable. Slim sat in the far corner, arms crossed, Beauregard
            hunched on his shoulder — cold fury, refusing to look at Freya. Freya sat opposite, staring at her own
            hands. Blood Feather watched both of them. Maltus stared out the window, pretending not to notice.
            Kiara curled up on the bench, tail wrapped around herself.</p>

        <p>Freya showed some regret about Tim, but no one forced a resolution. The rift stayed open — simmering,
            not boiling.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 1: Meeting Verity — The Payout</h2>

        <p>Verity Kye was waiting at The Sage's Quill. Professional as always.</p>

        <blockquote><em>"So how did it go?"</em></blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/verity_how_did_it_go.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>The payout: 4,000 gold pieces in marked casino currency, returned to the party. Verity kept her 5,000
            gold cut. The party asked about buying the Bag of Holding — Verity shut that down cold.</p>

        <p>On operational security:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"I had to maintain some operational security — nothing personal, just been burned too much."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/verity_ops_sec.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Then came the Quentin warning:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Quentin won't forget this. You embarrassed him in front of the tournament crowd, emptied his vault,
                AND stole his prize piece. He's petty, he's connected, and he has a direct line to the Nine Hells.
                Stay out of Varkenbluff for a while."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/verity_quentin_warning.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Someone brought up Tim. Verity's response was ice.</p>

        <blockquote><em>"I didn't ask for that."</em></blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/verity_tim_reaction.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h2>Act 2: Cassee Dannell — The Road Encounter</h2>

        <p>After leaving The Sage's Quill, the corrupted doctor appeared on the road. She stood unnaturally still —
            a puppet with cut strings.</p>

        <p>Krokulmar spoke through her first:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"You left her. In the dark. With the dreaming thing. The egg sleeps. But it remembers. It whispers
                to us now. To HER now."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/cassee_dark_dreaming.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Then a moment of clarity — Cassee, the real Cassee, breaking through:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Where am I? I was... I was in my study. The crystal box was glowing. And then... You. I asked for
                your help. You refused."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/cassee_clarity_moment.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Krokulmar returned — one final message:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"There is a house. In the forest. He reads from a book of stars. You cannot stop what is already
                dreaming."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/cassee_house_in_forest.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>The party watched in shock. No one attempted to restrain her. She vanished.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Long Evening — Drydock Cellar</h2>

        <p>Back in their underground hideout — the Drydock Cellar, inside the wooden ribs of an unfinished ship
            hull. Brass lanterns on hooks. A copper kettle steaming on a brazier. The calm after the storm.</p>

        <p><strong>Maltus</strong> recalled that casinos mark their currency — flagging the 4,000 gold pieces as
            traceable. Any spending over 50 gp risks detection.</p>

        <p><strong>Slim</strong> revealed a contact: <strong>Igor</strong>, who can launder gold through
            <strong>The Crucible</strong> — Greta Irontongue's river barge. He placed a filed coin at a tavern to
            summon Igor.
        </p>

        <p>And in the quiet, Blood Feather heard a whisper:</p>

        <blockquote><em>"The egg sleeps. But it dreams."</em></blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/cassee_egg_sleeps.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Morning After — Varkenbluff Errands</h2>

        <p>The party went topside for supplies and information — carefully.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slim</strong> placed a filed coin at a tavern to summon Igor (the laundering contact)</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Feather</strong> purchased two potions using clean (non-marked) currency</li>
            <li>The party noticed <strong>wanted posters</strong> — charcoal sketches of "the cowboy" and associates
                are circulating</li>
            <li>No marked gold was spent. The party was cautious.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 3: The Music Box Briefing</h2>

        <p>Molly delivered a parcel at The Sage's Quill. Inside: an ornate golden music box. When opened, it
            delivered the voice of the Golden Vault — grim news.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"Operatives. We come to you with a burden, not a request."</em><br><br>
            <em>"A sage named Vasil Talistrome — a friend of the Vault — has reported the theft of a book called
                The Celestial Codex..."</em><br><br>
            <em>"We sent four people to retrieve it. Good people. Experienced. They entered Delphi Mansion and did
                not come out."</em><br><br>
            <em>"Come back. That is not a request either."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/patron_music_box_briefing.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <hr>

        <h2>Act 3: Meeting Vasil Talistrome</h2>

        <p>Vasil — an elderly tiefling scholar — met the party at The Sage's Quill. He was drowning in
            correspondence, half-eaten stew, and grief.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/vasil_greeting.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>Markos Delphi</h3>

        <p>Vasil told them about his former student — <strong>Markos Delphi</strong>. Brilliant. Obsessive.
            A man who reached too far into the multiverse and contacted something from the Far Realm.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/vasil_markos_backstory.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>The Celestial Codex</h3>

        <p>The book itself: star maps and summoning rituals. Warnings misused as instructions. Markos stole it
            from Vasil's tower and retreated to his family estate — Delphi Mansion.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/vasil_codex_description.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>Elra Lionheart</h3>

        <p>Vasil hired a team of four — led by <strong>Elra Lionheart</strong> — to retrieve the Codex.
            Divination confirmed what he feared: they were dead. He carries the guilt.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/vasil_elra_hired.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>Tactical Intel</h3>

        <p>Vasil provided what he knew:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>"Destroy the anchors"</em> — crystals deep in the basement</li>
            <li><em>"The mansion may be warped"</em> — eldritch surges when magic is used</li>
            <li><em>"Reach Markos"</em> — a Persuasion check may break the entity's hold</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Reward: 100 gold per character for the Codex. An extra 150 if Markos is returned alive.</p>

        <h3>Departure</h3>

        <blockquote><em>"Don't let that be the end of his story."</em></blockquote>

        <h2>Act 4: The Forest Road — Elra's Ghost</h2>

        <p>The forest road to Delphi Mansion. The atmosphere shifted — dense ancient trees, heavy fog, the last
            light of dusk dying between gnarled oaks. Within one mile of the mansion, a spectral head appeared —
            floating at eye level, translucent blue-white.</p>

        <p><strong>Elra Lionheart.</strong> Dead, but not gone.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/elra_opening.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>She delivered a tactical briefing from beyond the grave — calm, matter-of-fact, almost wryly amused.</p>

        <h3>Mansion Warnings</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <em>"The mansion itself, mostly. It's... wrong. Rooms change. The air fights you."</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Creatures: <em>"Puddles of eyes and mouths"</em> — gibbering mouthers. Something with
            <em>"hooks for hands."</em>
        </p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/elra_mansion_warnings.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>The Camp</h3>

        <blockquote><em>"We had a camp. On a bluff due south of the mansion..."</em></blockquote>

        <p>Her backpack was still there — with a map and notes left by cultists.</p>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/elra_camp_intel.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>Spellcasting Warning</h3>

        <blockquote><em>"If someone casts a spell inside, it triggers these effects."</em></blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/elra_spellcasting_warning.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <h3>A Soldier's Last Request</h3>

        <blockquote><em>"I'd like to see my body again, if you find it."</em></blockquote>

        <audio controls style="width: 100%; margin: 1rem 0;">
            <source src="../assets/audio/session4/elra_body_request.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>

        <p>Elra confirmed she would <strong>accompany the party</strong> into the mansion.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Session End: Elra's Camp</h2>

        <p>The party arrived at a rocky bluff overlooking the forested valley. Through a gap in the trees:
            <strong>Delphi Mansion</strong> — a grand three-story stone manor, dark against the twilight sky.
            No lights. The angles slightly off, the shadows too deep.
        </p>

        <p>In Elra's backpack, they found the mansion map and three cultist notes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>"Markos has a room on the third floor where he performs rituals."</em></li>
            <li><em>"A cavernous room underneath the basement contains four large crystals — purpose unknown."</em>
            </li>
            <li><em>"Mansion windows can be unlocked using the password 'Krokulmar.'"</em></li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
